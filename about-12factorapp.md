# About The Twelve Factor App
## What is the Twelve Factor App?

The Twelve Factor App is a set of standards regarding how to build an application. They have been created over time by developers who have worked on numerous apps, and want to help other developers avoid common issues when building apps, provide definitions for terminology, and offer solutions to problems that a developer might face in the development process. As the title states, it gives twelve different steps from beginning to end on how to build an application, and goes into depth of each step and why it is necessary to go through it. 

## History of the Twelve Factor App

The origin of the Twelve Factor App started back in 2011, where developers that worked on Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS), were dealing with the transition into cloud computing. Since cloud computing dealt with applications on a different scale to traditional software computing, developers were left confused as they tried to apply traditional methods to this transitional period. As a result, Heroku engineers began to create their twelve factor methodology, which encompassed cloud computing issues like scalability, consistency between development and production, and lifecycle management. With their experience as engineers and developers at the forefront of cloud computing, they combined all their knowledge to make these steps so that others could follow their guidelines in order to create fully functional applications that are suited for the cloud. The creators of the Twelve Factor App have stated that they took inspiration for the structure from Martin Fowler's *'Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture'* and *'Refactoring'*, which are about the patterns and practices that developers should use so it is easier to create useful software.
