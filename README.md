## Welcome to our Wiki! 
# This page will serve as a starting point for those that are new to computing and are looking for a central place to find foundational information about computers and how they work. There are tutorials listed below on how to use different platforms such as Github, Docker, and Ubuntu so you can dive into these platforms immediately.
## Getting Started
1. [Set up GitHub](git-github.md)
- Github, using Git, which is an open source version control software, allows individuals to work on the same project simutaneously. Github, the site you are on right now, allows teams to work together on projects and provides a web interface for Git. 
2. [Set up Ubuntu](setup-ubuntu.md)
- Ubuntu is a open source operating system that is meant to be a more user-friendly version of other desktop Linux distributions. It was created in 2004 and the word 'Ubuntu' comes from the African Nguni language and translates to "humanity to others". It's name has proven to be useful to more than just people, as Ubuntu is used for servers, cloud platforms and IoT devices. In this tutorial you will download WSL2, which will allow you to use Ubuntu on your device. 
3. [Set up Docker](about-docker.md)
- Docker is a platform that packages applications into containers, which is known as containerization (you can read more about that [here](virtualization-containerization.md). It is used mainly by individual users and only requires one server to function.
